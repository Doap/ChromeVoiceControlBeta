This is a rough beta version that implements a one click method to start voice control.


HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to chrome://flags
3. enable "Exerimental Extension APIs
4. Restart Chrome
5. Go to chrome://extensions
6. Click "Load unpacked extension..." (if you don't see this make sure "Developer mode" is checked)
7. Navigate to the folder you cloned this repo to.
8. Click OK
9. You are done

HOW TO USE IT:

Same way you would the original extension. Just click ctrl + shift + z or ctrl + alt + z and you should see a popup that has already started voice control for you. 

NOTES:

Some features were removed from this version because of how I needed to create the extension. This will change soon and I'll add all the functionality back into it. Remember this is a beta if you have any issues please email egsDevelopment@gmail.com
